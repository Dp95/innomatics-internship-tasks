It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.\n","In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:\n","•\tThe year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:\n","•\tThe year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:\n","•\tThe year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.\n","This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.
