The analysis shows that student performance has improved in recent batches, with more learners scoring in the higher range (5–7). This indicates that the course content and teaching approach have become more effective over time.

However, a small group of students consistently scores low (0–2) across all batches, suggesting that some learners struggle with foundational concepts regardless of batch improvements.

To improve overall results, early identification of weak students and targeted support such as extra practice sessions or mentoring is recommended.
